## Moving Least Squares(MLS) with curves

`curve_plotting.m`: Plots curves with different values of Sigma for Moving Least Squares

## MLS for meshes(Smoothing meshes)

`smoothing_mesh_final_cat.m` : Smoothing mesh of object cat.off using MLS  

Results for smoothing the object file cat.off using MLS. Visualize the mesh using the application "Meshlab" (http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/).
